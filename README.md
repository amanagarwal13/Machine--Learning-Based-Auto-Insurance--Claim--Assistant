The    current   process   of   assessing   the   impact   of   damage   in   cars   for   insurance   purposes   is   time- consuming  and  prone  to  errors.
Insurance companies rely on physical inspections and expert opinions to estimate the cost of repairs, leading to delays in claim processing and possible inaccuracies in determining the actual damage. Sometimes it also happens that people bribe the inspection officer from the insurance company in order to pass their insurance claim in case they want to get something repaired out of the area of impact . This leads to a lot of loss to insurance companies in certain cases and at times it is the opposite where a claim is not approved for a certain part although the area of impact is more , in this case the customer is at loss as he/she has to shell out money in that case .
To address this issue, there is a need for a software that can accurately measure the impact of damage in cars, reducing the time and effort required for the assessment process.The software should be user-friendly, cost-effective, and provide reliable estimates for insurance purposes. Cutting out the middleman will provide justice for people on both ends of the claim.
The objective of this project is to design and develop a software solution that can accurately measure the impact of damage in cars using image processing and machine learning. This software aims to streamline insurance claims processing, reduce manual inspection efforts, minimize human error, and enhance damage assessment accuracy. Additionally, as a proactive measure against fraudulent activities, we propose maintaining a database of insurance claimants to identify and flag repeat offenders. This strategic approach will serve as both a deterrent and a source of valuable insights for risk assessment and fraud prevention. The project will also encompass an evaluation of the software's effectiveness, its potential industry-wide impact, and recommendations for future enhancements.
